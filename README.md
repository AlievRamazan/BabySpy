## 📖 About The Project

**Babyspy** is a smart child-tracking sensor and application ecosystem designed to optimize a parent's time and ensure the safety of toddlers exploring their environment.

Children under six are active explorers. While curiosity is vital for development, it often leads to accidents—breaking items or, more dangerously, injuries from windows or electrical appliances. Babyspy allows parents to monitor their child's proximity to dangerous zones within the house without hovering over them every second.

### 🏆 Recognition
*   **Nomination:** Smart City and Security

## 🚩 The Problem

Statistics regarding domestic childhood injuries are alarming:
*   In 2018 (Russia), **905 children** fell out of windows.
*   In 2013, **54 children** were injured at power grid facilities.
*   **50%** of injuries among children and adolescents are domestic (home) injuries.

Parents often sacrifice their own time and mental energy constantly monitoring a child's every move to prevent these accidents.

## 💡 The Solution

Babyspy is a compact, wearable sensor that pairs with a smartphone application.

### How It Works
1.  **The Sensor:** A small, safe device with no sharp edges attaches to the child's clothing.
2.  **The App:** Parents load a map of their house into the Babyspy smartphone app.
3.  **Safety Zones:** Parents mark "Dangerous Areas" on the map (e.g., open windows, electrical outlets, kitchen stoves).
4.  **Real-Time Alerts:** Using Bluetooth technology, if the sensor detects the child is entering a marked dangerous zone, the parent's phone rings immediately.

> **Smart Integration:** The system is designed to communicate with other smart home sensors (e.g., window sensors) to not only alert parents but potentially trigger safety mechanisms (like automatic window closing).

## 🎨 Design & Colors

The device features a discreet, rounded design to ensure it does not distract the baby or cause injury during play or sleep.

It is available in three colorways based on color psychology:
*   **🌸 Pink:** For girls.
*   **🍊 Orange:** Neutral.
*   **🍏 Green:** For boys.
